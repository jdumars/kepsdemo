# KEP Submitter:

keps-cli init $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/dry-run

ll $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run

# Take a look at metadata:
cat $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run/metadata.yaml

# Put the KEP summary content you want reviewed here
vi $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run/summary.md

# Put the KEP detailed content you want reviewed here
vi $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run/motivation.md

# Artifacts are ready for initial SIG review, so you propose it:
keps-cli propose $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run

# PR is then created for the enhancements repo, and reviewed
# If it is feasible (this can be a low bar because it's a draft)
# the PR gets merged and is ready for SIG acceptance. This is then ready for
# formal review of artifacts, and ideally done during a portion
# of the SIG meeting

# KEP DRAFT MERGED...

# KEP REVIEWER goes over motivation and summary and can:
# 1. defer/reject the KEP
# 2. accept the KEP meaning it is ready for further refinement 
# This is a low bar, because it is not ready to work yet
# it just gives the SIG some assurance that what is presented is
# feasible and reasonable

keps-cli accept $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run

# State gets changed to provisional:
cat $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run/metadata.yaml

# Provisional KEPs are refined, and more documents can be added
# this also allows time to organize the work
# getting plans figured out before implementable is important
# becuase you don't want "unfunded" KEPs just sitting out there
keps-cli plan $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run
cat $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run/metadata.yaml


# Once planned, and ready to work, a chair/TL marks the KEP
# approved for implementation 
keps-cli approve $KEPROOT/sig-api-machinery/sig-wide/dry-run

# State changes to implementable:
